# task-tracker
Task tracker is a personal project of mine to practice my python skills. This program lets you create tasks and edit them how you like. This is the first version and I will be updating it the more Python skills I learn. Next I will be using more object-orientated programming skills and expanding the task trackers functionality.

Instructions: Click run in your IDE to begin task tracker. You must create at least 1 objective before more menu options open up. You have the option of adding motivational quotes for yourself that will appear randomly whenever the program is started. The rest is self explanatory. One thing to note, "|" before a task means complete, "?" before a task means incomplete.

Python skills in use in this project: String manipulation, string formatting, file handling, modules and packages, control flow, data structures, functions, basic object-oriented programming concepts.
